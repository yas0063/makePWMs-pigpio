# makePWMs-pigpio

This class may be used to generate various PWM on multiple GPIO at the same time with pigpio for Raspberry Pi.

pigpio is a very powerful library to handle GPIO.
- The method of [hardware_PWM](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/python.html#hardware_PWM) easily generates PWM of two different frequencies.
- [Wave PWM 1 and Wave PWM 2](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/examples.html#Python%20code) give good examples and class of various PWM generation.

However, generation of more various PWMs on multiple GPIO (PWM with three or more different frequencies or PWM with phase difference) can not be generated by above methods.　This class is a wrapper class that sets PWM with pigpio and gives a method to set arbitrary waveforms of PWMs directly.


## Ｒequirements
- [pigpio](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/) 


## Usage
See mkPWMs.py

## TODO
- check values of pS, pH, pL and times to ensure that their sum does not exceed value of micros.
- allow the value of pS to be negative
